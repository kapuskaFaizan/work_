But there's far more here than meets the eye. That's because TG-Tracker is part of the Olympus Tough Family - worry-free cameras built to handle abuse so you can concentrate on getting great shots. TG-Tracker is waterproof to depths of 100 ft (30m), crushproof up to 220 lbf (100kgf), shockproof from 7ft (2.1m), freezeproof to 14F (-10C), and dustproof. Most other action cams need protective housings. That means more stuff to carry around, clumsy camera operation, and a difficult time capturing sound. With TG-Tracker, no housing equals better overall performance.\nFor adventurers looking to analyze their activities, switch the TG-Tracker to LOG mode to record the data from the camera's built-in GPS, compass, accelerometer, thermometer, and barometer. The location data from these sensors, such as location, altitude, direction, and temperature, can be viewed on the camera's monitor and downloaded for later use with the Olympus Image Track (OI.Track) mobile app.\n Main Features \n\nUHD 4K Video at 30 fps\nMaximum Lens Aperture: F2\n1080p at 60 fps \/ 720p at 120 fps\n8MP Photos\n204deg Lens\nWaterproof to 98.4' \/ Shockproof to 7'\nFreezeproof to 14F (-10C)\nBuilt-In LED Headlamp\nTilt-Out 1.5\" LCD\nBuilt-In Sensors Track Location\/Movement\nView Data Logs via OI.Track Mobile App\nRecording Media: microSD\/HC\/XC\nUnit Dimensions (WxHxD): 1.4 x 2.2 x 3.7\" \/ 35.0 x 56.5 x 93.2mm\nUnit Weight: 6.35 oz \/ 180 g including battery and card\n\n What's in the box \n\nOlympus Stylus Tough TG-Tracker Action Camera (Green)\nWrist Strap\nAC Adapter\nUSB Cable\nLens Protector\nUnderwater Lens Protector\nJoint Screw\nMount Coupling\nSteady Grip\nCD-ROM with User Manual and Software\n1 Year Limited Warranty\n\n\n1 Year Olympus Limited Warranty\n\n                    \"@en ","keyValuePairs_left":null,"keyValuePairs_right":{"":""},"price_left":null,"price_right":null,"specTableContent_left":null,"specTableContent_right":" Manufacturer: Olympus Sku #: oly_cool Our Price: $479.99 Quantity: \u00a0 Availability: Email for Availability FREE SHIPPING WITHIN CANADA!","title_left":" \"TP-Link 16-Port Gigabit Ethernet Switch (TL-SG1016)\"@en-US \"Routers - Page 4 | Laptops Outlet Direct\"@en-US","title_right":" \"Olympus Stylus Tough TG-Tracker Action Camera (Green) \"@en Aden \" Olympus | Digital SLR Cameras Toronto Canada Store"}

You can freely edit and resample using waveforms that you've loaded and preset samples. Modulation and effects can be controlled easily just by turning knobs on the top panel. In addition, a variety of input interfaces optimized for inputting rhythm, bass, or melody allow you to smoothly create sequences as fast as you can think. The sequences that you create can then undergo additional evolution on stage or in your laptop. You can enjoy intuitive live performances that link various devices with the Electribe sampler, or utilize this capability for full-fledged music production by exporting sequence data to Ableton Live for detailed editing and final mixing. \n\nThe latest system version 2 adds a much-requested pattern chain function that will be a great asset for live performances or music production. The lineup has also become more colorful with the new metallic red model. And we've also provided bonus patterns that reveal even greater sonic potential.

The integrated SATA 6 Gb\/s interface makes installation quick and easy while remaining backwards compatible with SATA II 3 Gb\/s and SATA 1.5 Gb\/s interfaces. This Samsung SSD even comes with 1GB of low power DDR2 SDRAM used as cache memory to enhance processing speeds.With a 2.5\" form factor, this solid state drive is designed to be used in a variety of notebook and desktop computers. The reduced size is achieved through the use of Samsung's 3D V-NAND flash memory as each of the 32 cell layers are stacked vertically rather than horizontally. Samsung also implements their own TurboWrite technology to deliver enhanced sequential read and write speeds while Rapid Mode software utilizes the integrated cache (DRAM) memory to improve processing speeds.

This feature enables higher DDR4 memory frequencies, lower latencies and enhanced stability while overclocking, extending all the way to extreme overclocking conditions, such as Liquid Nitrogen (LN2). Cache bus links areas such as CPU cores, DDR4 Memory Controllers, System Agent and the shared L3 Cache. It is a critical interconnect for the whole CPU subsystem. Higher cache bus frequency directly gives faster total sub-system performance. ASUS OC Socket exclusively provides an adjustable cache bus voltage to reach higher cache bus frequencies.This is a platform to support DDR4 memory and it's able to drive memory frequencies to 3200MHz (and beyond when overclocked)! ASUS-exclusive T-Topology circuit design plus OC Socket provides superb memory-overclocking capability to unleash the full power of DDR4 by minimizing coupling noise and signal reflection. More than just a cool military-styled cover, TUF Thermal Armor employs the fan to provide boosted airflow for rapid cooling. The special heat pipes accelerate dissipation from critical components and make sure temperatures stay low across the board. SABERTOOTH X99 Thermal Armor can reduce the temperature by up to 10\u00c2\u00b0C!SABERTOOTH X99 Thermal Radar 2 now has up to 11 fan connectors to let you control fans as many as you want.

To make this happen, Seagate engineers had to pack 340,000 hard drive tracks into the width of a single inch. This means that, when reading and writing data, the read\/write head needs to accurately follow a track that is a mere 75 nano meters wide. That's about 500 times smaller than the period at the end of this sentence. Seagate AcuTrac technology helps enable this incredible feat-reliably and accurately following these nano tracks even in challenging operating environments, like an all-in-one PC with the music turned up. Barracuda 1TB-per-disk hard drives now include a host of refined technologies to further boost performance. Combined, these improvements squeeze even more performance out of storage already known for pushing the envelope.Best-Fit Applications: Desktop or all-in-one PCs; Home servers; PC-based gaming systems; Desktop RAID; Direct-attached external storage devices (DAS); Network-attached storage devices (NAS).\n\n                        \" ","description_right":"\"Do you need more performance from your HPE ProLiant Server series or HPE Synergy platforms?

To make this happen, Seagate engineers had to pack 340,000 hard drive tracks into the width of a single inch. This means that, when reading and writing data, the read\/write head needs to accurately follow a track that is a mere 75 nano meters wide. That's about 500 times smaller than the period at the end of this sentence. Seagate AcuTrac technology helps enable this incredible feat-reliably and accurately following these nano tracks even in challenging operating environments, like an all-in-one PC with the music turned up. Barracuda 1TB-per-disk hard drives now include a host of refined technologies to further boost performance. Combined, these improvements squeeze even more performance out of storage already known for pushing the envelope.Best-Fit Applications: Desktop or all-in-one PCs; Home servers; PC-based gaming systems; Desktop RAID; Direct-attached external storage devices (DAS); Network-attached storage devices (NAS).\n\n                        \" ","description_right":"\"By now the world knows that Seagate Barracuda 7200 drives, from the world's premier storage provider, deliver years of reliable service and high performance. The ideal choice for workstations, desktop RAID, gaming PCs, high-end PCs, mainstream PCs and USB\/FireWire\/eSATA external storage. After years of pioneering research at Seagate, perpendicular recording is now a proven technology. It increases capacity and dependability by storing data vertically, rather than horizontally. And vertically stored data bits mean increased data density which means higher performance to increase productivity. This drive delivers excellent power savings without sacrificing drive or system performance, giving customers the ability to manufacture PC systems and external storage systems that meet energy savings requirements. Seagate hard drives have long been produced with the environment in mind, and not just with low power consumption. With Seagate and the Barracuda drive, our customers can have the best of both worlds, top hard-drive performance and the satisfaction of knowing they are using a high-capacity drive with a very small eco-footprint.\"@en-US ","keyValuePairs_left":null,"keyValuePairs_right":null,"price_left":null,"price_right":null,"specTableContent_left":null,"specTableContent_right":null,"title_left":" \"Seagate Desktop 2TB SATA III 3.5\" Hard Drive\" 64MB - ST2000DM001 | CCL Computers\" Drive 7200RPMrpm","title_right":" \"Seagate Desktop 2TB 3.5-Inch HDD SATA 6Gb\/s 64MB Cache Internal Bare Drive (ST2000DM001)\"@en-US \"Data Storage - Page 6 | Laptops Outlet Direct\"@en-US"}

It offers improved manageability by limiting downtime and maintaining productivity by isolating computing activities into separate partitions.\n\nIntel 64 architecture delivers 64-bit computing on server, workstation, desktop and mobile platforms when combined with supporting software. Intel 64 architecture improves performance by allowing systems to address more than 4 GB of both virtual and physical memory.\n\nIdle States are used to save power when the processor is idle. C0 is the operational state, meaning that the CPU is doing useful work. C1 is the first idle state, C2 the second, and so on, where more power saving actions are taken for numerically higher C-states.\n\nEnhanced Intel SpeedStep Technology is an advanced means of enabling high performance while meeting the power-conservation needs of mobile systems. Conventional Intel SpeedStep Technology switches both voltage and frequency in tandem between high and low levels in response to processor load. Enhanced Intel SpeedStep Technology builds upon that architecture using design strategies such as Separation between Voltage and Frequency Changes, and Clock Partitioning and Recovery.\n\nThermal Monitoring Technologies protect the processor package and the system from thermal failure through several thermal management features. An on-die Digital Thermal Sensor detects the core's temperature, and the thermal management features reduce package power consumption and thereby temperature when required in order to remain within normal operating limits.\n\nExecute Disable Bit is a hardware-based security feature that can reduce exposure to viruses and malicious-code attacks and prevent harmful software from executing and propagating on the server or network.\n\n                        \n                    \n                                                \n                                            \n                            Short summary description HP Intel Xeon 5130 2GHz 4MB L2 processor:\n                            This short summary of the HP Intel Xeon 5130 2GHz 4MB L2 processor data-sheet is auto-generated and uses the product title and the first six key specs.\n                            HP Intel Xeon 5130, Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae 5000 Sequence, 2 GHz, LGA 771 (Socket J), Server\/workstation, 65 nm, 64-bit\n                        \n                                                                \n                            Long summary description HP Intel Xeon 5130 2GHz 4MB L2 processor :\n                            HP Intel Xeon 5130.

To make this happen, Seagate engineers had to pack 340,000 hard drive tracks into the width of a single inch. This means that, when reading and writing data, the read\/write head needs to accurately follow a track that is a mere 75 nano meters wide. That's about 500 times smaller than the period at the end of this sentence. Seagate AcuTrac technology helps enable this incredible feat-reliably and accurately following these nano tracks even in challenging operating environments, like an all-in-one PC with the music turned up. Barracuda 1TB-per-disk hard drives now include a host of refined technologies to further boost performance. Combined, these improvements squeeze even more performance out of storage already known for pushing the envelope.Best-Fit Applications: Desktop or all-in-one PCs; Home servers; PC-based gaming systems; Desktop RAID; Direct-attached external storage devices (DAS); Network-attached storage devices (NAS).\n\n                        \" ","description_right":" with its practical design and sophisticated Power-Saving Mode.

To make this happen, Seagate engineers had to pack 340,000 hard drive tracks into the width of a single inch. This means that, when reading and writing data, the read\/write head needs to accurately follow a track that is a mere 75 nano meters wide. That's about 500 times smaller than the period at the end of this sentence. Seagate AcuTrac technology helps enable this incredible feat-reliably and accurately following these nano tracks even in challenging operating environments, like an all-in-one PC with the music turned up. Barracuda 1TB-per-disk hard drives now include a host of refined technologies to further boost performance. Combined, these improvements squeeze even more performance out of storage already known for pushing the envelope.Best-Fit Applications: Desktop or all-in-one PCs; Home servers; PC-based gaming systems; Desktop RAID; Direct-attached external storage devices (DAS); Network-attached storage devices (NAS).\n\n                        \" ","description_right":"\"2TB Capacity, SATA 6Gb\/s Interface, 7200RPM Spin Speed, 64MB Cache, 2 Year Warranty\"@en ","keyValuePairs_left":null,"keyValuePairs_right":null,"price_left":null,"price_right":null,"specTableContent_left":null,"specTableContent_right":null,"title_left":" \"Seagate Desktop 2TB SATA III 3.5\" Hard Drive\" 64MB - ST2000DM001 | CCL Computers\" Drive 7200RPMrpm","title_right":" \"Seagate 2TB 7200RPM SATA 6Gb\/s 64MB Cache HDD - OEM (ST2000DM001)\"@en \"\u25b7 Seagate (ST2000D\u2026 | OcUK\"@en"}
